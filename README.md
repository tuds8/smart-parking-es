The Parking Space Monitoring System is designed to manage and monitor parking space availability in a controlled environment. This system uses an ESP8266 microcontroller, an ultrasonic sensor for car detection, a servo motor to control a barrier,  a 7-segment LED display to show the number of available parking spaces, as well as a push button used for switching between operating modes: entering or leaving the parking.
